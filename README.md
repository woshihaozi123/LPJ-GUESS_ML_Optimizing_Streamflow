# LPJ-GUESS_ML_Optimizing_Streamflow
These codes are for optimizing long-term streamflow forecasting in the catchment integrating  Dynamic Global Vegetation Models and Interpretable Machine Learning

There are two different model configurations: LPJ-GUESS integrated with five ML models, and only ML models,  including hyperparameters optimization by random search algorithm and training data sensitivity test as well as the SHAP algorithms.
