# LPJ-GUESS_ML_Optimizing_Streamflow
These codes are for optimizing long-term streamflow forecasting in the catchment integrating  Dynamic Global Vegetation Models and Interpretable Machine Learning

There are two different model configurations: LPJ-GUESS integrated with five ML models, and only ML models,  including hyperparameters optimization by random search algorithm and training data sensitivity test as well as the SHAP algorithms.

Five models are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM). ET and GBD models are also tested but not better.
